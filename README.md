#Ｂｉｇ ｔｅｘｔ ｍａｋｅｒ

This is a small, mostly useless library which converts normal text to [fullwidth unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halfwidth_and_fullwidth_forms) text.

See a live version [here](https://cdn.rawgit.com/ivarboms/big.js/master/big.html).

Uses [Textillate.js](http://textillate.js.org/) for fancy but completely unnecessary text effects.
